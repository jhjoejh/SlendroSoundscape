# SlendroSoundscape
Slendro Soundscape is a virtual musical installation in which the listenerâ€™s location/movement within an artificial environment determines what they are hearing. Its acousmatic sounds are composed of various sustained sonorities that fade in and out in rhythms evocative of meditative breathing.
